- Implemented robust data cleaning techniques to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, laying a solid foundation for accurate analysis
  
### Advanced Measure Development:
- Developed and implemented a suite of advanced measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate critical hospitality metrics, including revenue, occupancy rates, and average daily rate (ADR).
- Designed complex calculations to derive insights into booking patterns, cancellation rates, and platform-specific booking distribution, enriching the depth of analysis.
- 
### Dashboard Design and Visualization:
- Designed and created visually compelling dashboards using Power BI, featuring intuitive layouts and interactive visualizations to facilitate easy data exploration and interpretation.
- Customized dashboard components to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions at a glance.
### Strategic Insights and Decision Support:
- Delivered actionable insights and strategic recommendations to stakeholders based on data-driven analysis, empowering them to optimize revenue generation, occupancy rates, and guest satisfaction.
- Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to interpret findings, identify opportunities for improvement, and drive strategic initiatives aligned with organizational objectives.
### Impact and Results:
- Demonstrated tangible business impact through the implementation of data-driven insights, resulting in improved revenue performance, enhanced occupancy rates, and optimized operational efficiency within the hospitality domain.
Received positive feedback from stakeholders for the clarity, relevance, and utility of the Power BI dashboard in supporting decision-making processes and driving business outcomes.
### Continuous Improvement and Innovation:
- Continuously iterated on the Power BI solution based on stakeholder feedback and evolving business requirements, incorporating new features, visualizations, and data sources to enhance functionality and usability.
Demonstrated a commitment to excellence and innovation in leveraging data analytics to solve complex business challenges and deliver value-added solutions to stakeholders.
